## Welcome

I am a PhD student in [political science](https://polisci.la.psu.edu/people/duan-songtao/) and [social data analytics](https://soda.la.psu.edu/) at the [Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/). Prior to Penn State, I was a consultant and research assistant at the [Center for Global Development](https://www.cgdev.org/) in Washington D.C. I was also a graduate fellow at the [Reppy Institute for Peace and Conflict Studies](https://einaudi.cornell.edu/programs/reppy-institute-peace-and-conflict-studies) and the [Emerging Market Program](https://emergingmarkets.dyson.cornell.edu/smart/smart-2022-23/) at Cornell University.

My research interests focus on political economy of development, specifically foreign aid, civil conflicts, and multilateral development organizations.  My work has been supported by the Vice Provost and Dean's Scholarship, the Miller-LaVigne Distinguished Graduate Fellowship, the Paterno Graduate Fellowship, Mario Einaudi Center for International Studies, Einhorn Center for Community Engagement, and Cornell Brooks School of Public Policy.  

For inquiries, please reach out to me at [sduan@psu.edu](mailto:sduan@psu.edu), or connect with me on Bluesky [@sduan.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/sduan.bsky.social).
