## Welcome

I am a PhD student in [political science](https://polisci.la.psu.edu/) at the [Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/).  Prior to Penn State, I was a consultant and research assistant at the [Center for Global Development](https://www.cgdev.org/) in Washington D.C. My research interests include political economy of development, with a special focus on foreign aid, political violence, state building, and multilateral development organizations. I received MPA in International Development and Peace Science from [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) in 2023, where I was also a graduate fellow at the [Reppy Institute for Peace and Conflict Studies](https://einaudi.cornell.edu/programs/reppy-institute-peace-and-conflict-studies) and the [Emerging Market Program](https://emergingmarkets.dyson.cornell.edu/). 

My work has been supported by generous funding from the Bruce R. Miller and Dean D. Lavigne Distinguished Graduate Fellowship, Cornell Institute for African Development, Cornell Southeast Asia Program, Einaudi Center for International Studies, Einhorn Center for Community Engagement, and Brooks School Student Opportunity Grant.
