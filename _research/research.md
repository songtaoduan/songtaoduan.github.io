## Work in Progress
* Revival Projects in International Development: Evidence from Chinese Global Infrastructure since 1949 (with [Austin Strange](https://www.austinstrange.org/))
    * <span style="font-size: 14px;">*Abstract:* How do historical interactions between states affect their contemporary relations? We
examine this broader question in the context of Chinese overseas development projects.
We examine Chinese-financed and built infrastructure projects that the Chinese government has “revived” in recent years. China’s contemporary infrastructure drive and the Belt and Road Initiative have attracted intense scrutiny. But China’s government
also financed several hundred infrastructure projects in dozens of developing regions be-
tween 1949 and 1999. We theorize that revival projects have multiple political functions
that explain China’s willingness to spend resources revitalizing and branding them. To
assess these claims, we provide new evidence showing China’s government has revived
a significant portion of these projects by refurbishing, modernizing, or expanding them.
Using new datasets on China’s 20th- and 21st-century overseas development finance,
we document over 80 revival projects across over 280 project records, many of which
represent some of China’s most high-profile international development projects. We
also include an illustrative case, Burundi’s Mugere Hydropower Station and Sierra
Leone’s National Stadium, that demonstrates the various contemporary political func-
tions of these historical projects. Earlier research has long suggested that China is not
a new donor or lender in international development, and our study helps illuminate
the contemporary political logic of historical development cooperation between China
and host countries. 

* Helping or Hindering? Outcomes of the U.S. Counterinsurgency (COIN) Intervention (with [Zinab Attai](https://government.cornell.edu/zinab-attai))
    * <span style="font-size: 14px;">*Abstract:* Post World War II, the U.S. has been the most prolific intervener in intra-state conflicts.
This intervention is often to provide COIN support to weak, conflict-affected states.
Despite the prevalence of U.S. COIN support in the international system, there has
been limited, large-N analysis of how U.S. COIN support affects conflict outcomes in
an affected state. We fill the gap by offering empirical evidence of the near-term effect
of U.S. COIN support on intrastate conflict outcomes and its long-term impacts on the
state capacity of affected states. To pursue this study, we developed an original dataset
on U.S. military interventions and the outcomes of insurgencies since 1945. Results
show that while U.S. COIN support was useful for defeating insurgents in affected
states, such intervention hinders state capacity in the long term. We argue this failure
is largely attributable to the lack of understanding of local context. We further test this
theory by empirically examining the impacts of U.S. COIN intervention in Afghanistan.
This study provides important policy implications for the government to take steps to
refine its counterinsurgency strategy.

* From Text to Behaviors: Analysis of Chinese Foreign Aid Discourse and Allocation (1960-2020)  
    * <span style="font-size: 14px;">*Abstract:* China, as a non-traditional creditor, is known to use most of its development finance to
build high-profile infrastructure projects. While existing literature tries to understand
this feature by analyzing China’s motives for giving aid, relatively little attention has
been paid to how the Chinese government frames these goals in its official discourse and
whether the variation of official rhetoric has impacts on actual aid flows. I address this
gap by introducing a novel corpus based on the People’s Daily online database, covering
326 text documents surrounding Chinese foreign aid from 1960 to 2020. Using both
hand coding and computer-assisted text analysis, I identify a shift in predominant
topics of Chinese aid discourse over time. I also find that Chinese aid discourse is
more likely to be associated with aid spending on economic infrastructure projects
than social infrastructure and humanitarian projects. These findings imply that the
future trend of China’s aid discourse and flows may involve downplaying the pursuit
of economic interests, emphasizing China’s contributions to the global public goods,
and maintaining relatively stable aid flows. This study contributes to the literature on
foreign policy-making in authoritarian settings. It also provides valuable information
for beneficiary countries and other creditors on whether official discourse can be useful
for analyzing Chinese aid policy.
