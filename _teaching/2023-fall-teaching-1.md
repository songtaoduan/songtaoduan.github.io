This course prepares students for engaged-learning opportunities that include working with diverse community partners e.g., small and medium enterprises, NGOs, universities, and public agencies in emerging markets. This course comprises two sections: 1. Field research methods, which provide students with a strong theoretical grounding on how to collect and report primary data in publishable works (e.g., case studies). 2. Development of field safety, research protocols and client pre-engagement opportunities for students who have successfully been selected to participate in the Student Multidisciplinary Applied Research Teams (SMART) projects.
